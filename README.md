## Inspiration
- During online learning/presenting, we realized that it is hard to gauge the audience's attention
- Unlike in-person learning, it isn't easy to see other users and their faces for a long period of time
- To make it easier to gauge how the audience is feeling, we decided to record the emotions of the students so the teacher/presenter can have an accurate summary of how the audience has been feeling

## What it does
- With the use of artificial intelligence and face-recognition API, EduLink allows teachers to determine how students are feeling by providing them with a live summary of the audienceâ€™s emotions. 

## How we built it
- EduLink was made using React, face-api.js, and Bootstrap.

## Challenges we ran into
It was our first time using a face-recognition API, so we had to learn how to implement it into our website. Additionally, most of our team started with little experience in web development, which meant we came across many hurdles that we had to overcome. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We are proud of the overall design and functionality of EduLink 
## What we learned
- How to use React and face-api.js

## What's next for EduLink
- Created customized chatrooms
- Allow for multiple users to use at once
